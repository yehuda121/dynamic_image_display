# dynamic_image_display
This Python program dynamically displays an image divided into smaller parts, showing selected parts at full brightness while dimming the rest for a transparent background effect. The idea is to create a mechanism to protect sensitive images from being captured using external devices, such as filming with a camera.
The program achieves this by displaying only a portion of the image at any given time, with the rest dimmed. The ultimate goal (not yet fully realized) is to match the display's refresh rate with the frame rate of most smartphone cameras when recording video. By doing so, the same parts of the image would appear in every captured video frame, making it impossible to reconstruct the full image, similar to the optical illusion in rare helicopter videos where the propellers appear stationary due to synchronization with the camera's shutter speed.
